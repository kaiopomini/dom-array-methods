# dom-array-methods
 
 this is a simple application for use the arrays methods, so it was used the API [Randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) to generate the names, and with an async function with fetch to get the names.

 At this time, I have used the arrays methods for:
 
 - map() to double money value in entire list
 - sort() to organize by richest values
 - filter() to show users who have money values above 1M
 - reduce() to calculate the sum of money values
 - forEach() to update DOM
